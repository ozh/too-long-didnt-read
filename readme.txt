Too Long; Didn't Read.

== Description ==

This fun plugin just replaces the "Excerpt" meta-box with something more meaningful for the Modern Redditor.

Oh, also, it's a neat example of custom string replacement using a filter over gettext :)


== Support ==

On [Github](https://github.com/ozh/<plugin name>). I don't read WordPress support forums.


== Screenshots ==

1. TL;DR.


== Installation ==

Installation is, as usual :

1. Upload files to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory (preserve sub-directory structure if applicable)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Refer to the official plugin page for documentation, usage and tips
